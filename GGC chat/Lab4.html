      A few years ago, Georgia Gwinnett College was home to just over 100
      students. Let’s just say – things have changed. What was once 260 acres of
      rolling terrain has become the perfect metropolitan college campus of
      about&nbsp;12,000 students. What’s so perfect about it? GGC adapts to how
      you do things – your learning style, your work schedule and your life.
      From the ground up, GGC was designed to help you succeed. That's game
      changing.
    </p>
    <h2>Founded</h2>
    <p>
      In 1994,
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gwinnettcounty.com/"
        >Gwinnett County</a
      >
      was the largest county east of the Mississippi without a four-year
      college. So Gwinnett County leaders purchased 160 acres of land and
      designated it specifically for the development of a college campus. GGC
      opened its doors in 2006 as the first four-year college founded in Georgia
      in more than 100 years, and the first four-year, public college created in
      the U.S. in the 21st century. Georgia Gwinnett College is a member of the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usg.edu/"
        >University System of Georgia.
      </a>
    </p>
    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>
      The College is located in
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lawrencevillega.org/"
        >Lawrenceville, Georgia</a
      >, in the heart of
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gwinnettcounty.com/"
        >Gwinnett County</a
      >. Gwinnett is a vibrant community 30 miles northeast of downtown Atlanta
      where a mixture of quiet postcard neighborhoods and bustling commercial
      districts blend the past with the present. Here, progress and quality of
      life connect so that everyone enjoys the small town ambience with all the
      amenities of a big city. Businesses and residents alike enjoy safe
      neighborhoods, good schools, modern infrastructure and a thriving
      economy.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwinnett County remains one of the most dynamic regions in the South to
      live and work with an estimated population of about 896,000 with&nbsp;1.2
      million projected by the year 2025.

      the lives of others.
    </p>
    <h3>Leadership</h3>
    <p>
      GGC inspires its graduates to model purposeful, intentional actions that
      enable them, and those around them, to work together in cohesive and
      coherent ways toward common goals. Our students lead by example, with both
      their hearts and their minds, while encouraging others to do the same.

    <h3>Service</h3>
    <p>
      Georgia Gwinnett College encourages each graduate to live as engaged,

    <h2>Policy Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      The authoritative source of information concerning Board approved policies
      and procedures governing academic and administrative matters is the Policy
      Manual of the Board of Regents. In cases of inconsistency, Board of
      Regents policy takes precedence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Administrative Policy Manual is Georgia Gwinnett College's primary
      policy manual. In the event of a conflict between the Faculty Manual,
      Catalog or Student Handbook and the Administrative Policy Manual, the
      Administrative Policy Manual prevails.
